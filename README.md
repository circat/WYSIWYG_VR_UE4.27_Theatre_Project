<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is about the possibilities of virtual production in performing arts.

We created a virtual space and used a set up of different technics to enable a real time performance in VR. 

This was a very exciting journey, thought we are at the beginning of real time VR experiences as a new aesthetic experience.
